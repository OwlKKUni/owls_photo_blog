Github repo with the newest version for the final project

This is my photo blog website idea

IMPORTANT - IF THE INDEX PAGE IS NOT DISPLAYING PROPERLY CHANGE THE WIDTH OF THE SITE BACK AND FORTH
            AND IT SHOULD REALIGN ITSELF - I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSES THIS TO HAPPEN

            IF THE WIDTH OF THE SITE IS SMALL THE BURGER BUTTON WILL POP UP - CLICK IT TO DISPLAY THE NAVIGATION BAR
            IT HAS SOME CUSTOM JS CODE TO MAKE IT WORK

Index - main site with all the photos (maybe in future I will create a page for each of the photos)
    For now - only the photo of a house has a separate page

Article - page for each photo with some text surounding it - rn have no idea what I want to disclose in this section

TODO:
    #0 - FINISH THE FUCKING SITE
    #1 - Create navigation between the sites

    #2 - host the website online after finished
    #3 - create wireframe and site map
    #4 - create presentation
